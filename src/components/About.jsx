          I’m a professional web developer with experience building and
          maintaining enterprise-level applications. My range of knowledge lies
          across the full stack of development, from creating rich and robust
          user interfaces to building and testing APIs. I currently work on the
          front end team at Overstock.com, where my contributions to projects
          have been estimated to save 600+ hours of work per year.{' '}
